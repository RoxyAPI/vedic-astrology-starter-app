/**
 * The single Roxy SDK client for the whole app. `createRoxy` sets the base URL and injects the auth header on every request, so there is no base URL to configure and no generated schema to keep in sync: the SDK ships its own types. One key unlocks every domain in the catalog, including `roxy.vedicAstrology.*` for Jyotish and KP and `roxy.location.*` for geocoding birth cities.
 *
 * @remarks This is a mobile app with no server, so the key is bundled into the build and reaches the device. Treat `EXPO_PUBLIC_ROXYAPI_KEY` as a public, restricted key (lock it to your bundle id / origin in the dashboard) or proxy calls through a thin backend you control. Read {@link hasApiKey} before rendering a screen that calls the API.
